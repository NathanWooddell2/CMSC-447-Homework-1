                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> 
                Hello, I am Nathan Wooddell, <br>
                I am a senior Computer science student here at <a href ="https://umbc.edu/">University of Maryland - Baltimore County</a> <br>
                Besides computer science, I am also studying Russian Language, and will recieve a certificate. <br>
                    
                <br>On campus I like to participate in several clubs, especially UMBC cyberdawgs, and the Russian club.<br>
                In my free-time I like to paint tabletop miniatures, play videogames, and 3D model/3D print.<br>
                And just so you know who I am I have included a picture of myself below!<br> 
                <br><img src="selfportrait.jpg" width="350" height="350">
                <br> <br>
                Since we talk about games in class fairly often I think I'll share my favorite game: Escape from Tarkov. This is my favorite game, especially when I'm not actually playing it. 
                <br><br>
                A final fact about me, is that I used to work as a night host at a summer camp. That was probably my favoite job to date.
                <br>

                <h3>Some Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>
                    I used bootstrap in an attempt to make this page look better, and I think it almost worked.<br>
                    <br> Crocodiles can't stick their tounges out.<br>
                    <img src="crocodile.gif" width="340" height=""><br> 
                    <br> Pigs, when determined enough can actually fly. <br>
                    <img src="pig.gif" width="340" height=""> <br>
                    <br> Penguins can only see out of one eye. <br>
                    <img src="penguin.gif" width="340" height=""><br>
                    Only one of these fun facts is actually true, but you can click the button below to see which one:
                    <br><br>
                    <button class="btn btn-danger" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
                        Reveal The Answrer
                    </button>
                
                    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
                        <div class="card card-body text-black text-center">
                            It is actually the crocodile one, believe it or not, crocodiles actually cannot stick their tounges out. I made the other two up.<br>

                <h3>Some Other Fun Stuff</h3>
        
                <p>
                    I wanted to give my website some music, but it seems that autoplay is disabled on chromium browsers, <br>
                    so unfortunately I had to provide controls for the audio, and it doesn't just play. But anyway, I hope you<br>
                    like the track concerning hobbits from the opening to the movie adaptaiton of "The Fellowship of the Ring"<br>
                </p>
                <audio controls autoplay loop>
                <source src = "concerninghobbits.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                </audio>
                <br><br>
                <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
